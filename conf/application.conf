# This is the main configuration file for the application.
# https://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/ConfigFile
# ~~~~~
# Play uses HOCON as its configuration file format.  HOCON has a number
# of advantages over other config formats, but there are two things that
# can be used when modifying settings.
#
# You can include other configuration files in this main application.conf file:
#include "extra-config.conf"
#
# You can declare variables and substitute for them:
#mykey = ${some.value}
#
# And if an environment variable exists when there is no other subsitution, then
# HOCON will fall back to substituting environment variable:
#mykey = ${JAVA_HOME}

## Application name and version
app {
    version   = "0.1.0"
    name      = "survey"

    ## CORS filter configuration
    # https://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/CorsFilter
    # ~~~~~
    # CORS is a protocol that allows web applications to make requests from the browser
    # across different domains.
    # NOTE: You MUST apply the CORS configuration before the CSRF filter, as CSRF has
    # dependencies on CORS settings.
    cors {
        # Filter paths by a whitelist of path prefixes
        #pathPrefixes = ["/some/path", ...]

        # The allowed origins. If null, all origins are allowed.
        #allowedOrigins = ["http://www.example.com"]

        # The allowed HTTP methods. If null, all methods are allowed
        #allowedHttpMethods = ["GET", "POST"]
    }

    ## CSRF Filter
    # https://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/JavaCsrf#Applying-a-global-CSRF-filter
    # ~~~~~
    # Play supports multiple methods for verifying that a request is not a CSRF request.
    # The primary mechanism is a CSRF token. This token gets placed either in the query string
    # or body of every form submitted, and also gets placed in the users session.
    # Play then verifies that both tokens are present and match.
    csrf {
        # Sets the cookie to be sent only over HTTPS
        #cookie.secure = true

        # Defaults to CSRFErrorHandler in the root package.
        #errorHandler = MyCSRFErrorHandler
    }

    ## Security headers filter configuration
    # https://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/SecurityHeaders
    # ~~~~~
    # Defines security headers that prevent XSS attacks.
    # If enabled, then all options are set to the below configuration by default:
    headers {
        # The X-Frame-Options header. If null, the header is not set.
        #frameOptions = "DENY"

        # The X-XSS-Protection header. If null, the header is not set.
        #xssProtection = "1; mode=block"

        # The X-Content-Type-Options header. If null, the header is not set.
        #contentTypeOptions = "nosniff"

        # The X-Permitted-Cross-Domain-Policies header. If null, the header is not set.
        #permittedCrossDomainPolicies = "master-only"

        # The Content-Security-Policy header. If null, the header is not set.
        #contentSecurityPolicy = "default-src 'self'"
    }

    ## Allowed hosts filter configuration
    # https://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/AllowedHostsFilter
    # ~~~~~
    # Play provides a filter that lets you configure which hosts can access your application.
    # This is useful to prevent cache poisoning attacks.
    hosts {
        # Allow requests to example.com, its subdomains, and localhost:9000.
        #allowed = [".example.com", "localhost:9000"]
